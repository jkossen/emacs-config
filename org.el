;; Precise behaviour of org-present during start and quit is

;; images, hide the cursor and make the buffer read-only:
(autoload 'org-present "org-present" nil t)
(eval-after-load "org-present"
  '(progn
     (add-hook 'org-present-mode-hook

                 (org-display-inline-images)
                 (org-present-hide-cursor)
                 (org-present-read-only)))
